# Getting Started

This is a data finder integration to retrieve local (or remote) fuel price data for Home Assistant using the `pyfuelprices` library. This library aims to provide the most extensive set of data sources for fuel prices in the world.

You can use this service to:

- Track fuel prices in your local area
- Query for fuel prices in an automation
- Calculate how much it will cost to fill your tank of fuel
- Find the cheapest station near a entity providing latitude and longitude (script required)

## Warnings

- Commercial usage of this integration and its Python library is strictly prohibited.
- You may fork and modify as you require or contribute to the project freely.
